# Our mission
**We’re committed to building great security so that developers are free to build remarkable applications.
build.security is setting the standard for modern policy management and enforcement, starting with a new, data-driven vision and approach to authorization—covering everything from basic role and permission models to sophisticated attribute-based access controls.**

It’s time to bring maturity and simplicity to authorization, and we’re leading the way with a managed, off-the-shelf policy platform.

We believe that the best security is powered by community. This largely inspired us to open-source our core technology and keep it accessible to all developers. Join us for the ride to bring meaningful change to authorization.
